# minishell

This is a Mini- Shell project to understand Unix programming.  
It is written in C. 

The official README file is located on the src file.  
The following is the layout of the project file.

/minishell
/minishell/src  -- your source subtree which can have additional subdirectories, of course
/minishellsrc/man -- the source for your man page in the right man page subfolder (e.g. man1).  This is for the man page that you develop.
/minishell/src/docs -- a report on your project effort
/minishell/src/Makefile -- the Makefile for building your executable
/minishell/src/README -- instructions for using the Makefile to build your system including an explanation of any build options
/minishell/install -- your running code subtree
/minishell/install/bin -- where your shell executable goes
/minishell/install/man -- where your installed man page for the shell goes (in the right man page subfolder).  This is for the man page that people display.
